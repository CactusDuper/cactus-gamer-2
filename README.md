# RGB PCIe card

This repo contains all of the needed code to flash the rp2040 as well as the software for the computer you want to use the card with.

Some features are a WIP still, more testing needs to be done to make this a commercial product. Everything currently included in this repo has been tested and confirmed working.

Currently working on the overheating protection algorithm, it should be customizable by the user.
